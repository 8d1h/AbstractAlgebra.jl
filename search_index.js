    "category": "section",
    "text": "As we explained in the previous section, Julia types don't contain enough information to properly model the ring of integers modulo n for a multiprecision modulus n. Instead of using types to construct objects, we use special objects that we refer to as parent objects. They behave a lot like Julia types.Consider the following simple example, to create a Flint multiprecision integer:n = ZZ(\"12345678765456787654567890987654567898765678909876567890\")Here ZZ is not a Julia type, but a callable object. However, for most purposes one can think of such a parent object ZZ as though it were a type."

Types are almost never dealt with directly when scripting  AbstractAlgebra.jl to do mathematical computations. In contrast, AbstractAlgebra.jl developers will want to know how we model mathematical objects and their rings, fields, groups, etc."

    "text": "Abstract types in Julia can also belong to one another in a hierarchy. We make use of such a hierarchy to organise the kinds of mathematical objects in AbstractAlgebra.jl.For example, the AbstractAlgebra.Field abstract type belongs to the  AbstractAlgebra.Ring abstract type. In practice, this means that any generic function in AbstractAlgebra.jl which is designed to work with ring objects will also work with field objects.In AbstractAlgebra.jl we also distinguish between the elements of a field, say, and the field itself.For example, we have an object of type Generic.PolyRing to model a generic polynomial ring, and elements of that polynomial ring would have type Generic.Poly. For this purpose, we also have a hierarchy of abstract types, such as FieldElem, that the types of element objects can belong to.(Image: alt text)"

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Naively, one might have expected that rings in AbstractAlgebra.jl could be modeled as types and their elements as objects with the given type. But there are various reasons why this is not a good model.Consider the ring R = mathbbZnmathbbZ for a multiprecision integer n. If we were to model the ring R as a type, then the type would somehow need to contain the modulus n. This is not possible in Julia, and in fact it is not desirable, since the compiler would then recompile all the associated functions every time a different modulus n was used.We could attach the modulus n to the objects representing elements of the ring, rather than their type.But now we cannot create new elements of the ring mathbbZnmathbbZ given only their type, since the type no longer contains the modulus n.Instead, the way we get around this in AbstractAlgebra.jl is to have special (singleton) objects that act like types, but are really just ordinary Julia objects. These objects, called parent objects can contain extra information, such as the modulus n. In order to create new elements of mathbbZnmathbbZ as above, we overload the call operator for the parent object.In the following AbstractAlgebra.jl example, we create the parent object R corresponding to the ring mathbbZ7mathbbZ. We then create a new element a of this ring by calling the parent object R.R = ResidueRing(JuliaZZ, 7)\na = R(3)Here, R is the parent object, containing the modulus 7. So this example creates  the element a = 3 pmod7."
