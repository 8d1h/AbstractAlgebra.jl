# Nemo

## What is Nemo?

Nemo is a computer algebra package for the Julia programming language. Our aim is to provide a highly
performant computer algebra package covering

  - Commutative Algebra
  - Number Theory
  - Group Theory

Nemo consists of wrappers of specialised C/C++ libraries:

  - Flint    [http://flintlib.org/]
  - Arb      [http://fredrikj.net/arb/]
  - Antic    [https://github.com/wbhart/antic/]
  - Singular [https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/]
  - Pari     [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/]

It will also eventually provide interfaces to interpreted library code from other computer algebra
systems such as Gap and Singular.
