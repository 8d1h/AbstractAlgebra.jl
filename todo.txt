General
-------

* Implement isequal for strict equality, e.g. isequal(1+O(x), 1+O(x^2)) == false

* Add test code

* change names of shift_left/right

* add deepcopy methods

* fix issues with stack overflow on nonexistent operators

* work out how to add /(a::Poly{T}, a::T) methods, etc, without conflicts

* implement type stable division which doesn't assume exactness

Poly.jl
-------

* Fix printing of monomials, e.g. y + (x), y + (6)

* Fix efficiently powering of x in flint specialised polynomials cases

* function to convert poly to array

* make special arithmetic polynomial functions take a variable, not a type, so they can be used with generators of other poly rings

* check flint pseudodivision really returns a result with the power of L as defined in the nemo docs

* check the resultant and bezout functions for flint polys work correctly for nonmonic polys

* correct description of bezout for nonmonic polys

* Should mod be defined for polys over ZZ where the divisor is monic?

* implement fmpz_mod_poly_get_str_pretty and use it in show

ZZ.jl
-----

* defining % automatically defines rem, so remove one from ZZ

Residue.jl
----------

* Make powering do its own powmod

* implement divexact by an invertible integer, etc

FLINT
-----

* fix printing of parentheses in polys over finite fields

* fix issue with dll production on Windows

* document and test fq_poly_scalar_div_fq

* add fq_poly_scalar_div_ui/si/fmpz

* implement print_pretty_series (reverse order of coeffs)

* suppress printing of 1 coeffs in fmpq_poly_print_pretty

* fmpq_poly_inv_series can be faster than Sage's power series inversion

* fix isprime bug

* document and test set_exact_fmpz, add_exact, mul_exact, sub_exact, inv_exact, div_exact, sqrt_exact, pow_exact_si, div_exact_fmpz

PowerSeries.jl
--------------

* allow division by power series with non-invertible leading coeff if division
can still be performed

* ensure exp is only defined for rings in which division by an integer is
possible
